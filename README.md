# 🎄 Advent of Code 2022

My [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022/) solutions on TypeScript.

### Local setup

If you (for whatever reason) decided to clone the repo and run it locally, here is what you need to do:

1. Make sure you have Node.js 18 and npm installed
2. Install dependencies with `npm i`
3. Run `npm run test` – it will execute all solutions and check results
